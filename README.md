# compliance-operator [![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.scorecard.dev/projects/github.com/rancher/compliance-operator/badge)](https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/rancher/compliance-operator)

The compliance-operator enables running Compliance security scans on a Kubernetes cluster and generate compliance reports that can be downloaded.
Benchmarks tests and the execution logic lives on [rancher/security-scan].

## Building

`make`


## Running
1. Install the custom resource definitions:
- `kubectl apply -f crds/`
2. Install the operator
`./bin/compliance-operator`


## Branches and Releases
### General information
The current branch strategy for `rancher/compliance-operator` is laid out below:

| Branch                | Tag      |Security-Scan          | Rancher                   |
|-----------------------|----------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| `main`                | `head`   |`main` branch (`head`)`| `main` branch (`head`)    |
| `release/v1.0`        | `v1.0.x` |`v0.7.x`               | `v2.12.x`                 |

Note that it aligns with Rancher Manager releases to maximize compatibility
within the ecosystem. This includes k8s dependencies that the Rancher release
aims to support, meaning that compliance-operator should use the same k8s minor release
that the Rancher release line it aims to support.

Active development takes place against `main`. Release branches are only used for
bug fixes and security-related dependency bumps.

Refer to the [Support Compatibility Matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/)
for official compatibility information.

### How future release branches should be generated
Follow these guidelines when releasing new branches:
1. Name convention to be used: `release/v1.x.x`.
2. Update the [Branch and Releases](https://github.com/rancher/compliance-operator#branches-and-releases) table with the new branches and remove the no longer needed branches.
